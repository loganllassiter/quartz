#### 1. Prepare existing local directory to be added to GitHub

* If you do not have an existing local directory to use for your Github repository create one
	```bash
	$ mkdir [directory-name]
	```

	Here is a guide to [create a repo from an existing local directory](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github)
* Use the following commands (if you run into trouble revert to linked guide):
	```bash
	$ cd [your-local-directory]
	$ git init -b main
	$ touch .gitignore
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m "First commit"
	```
	1. change directory to the local directory you want to use for your repo
	2. initialize the main branch
	3. create .gitignore file (more on .gitignore below)
	4. stage the files for initial commit
	5. commits/saves changes and prepares them to be pushed

#### 2. Create and link GitHub repo with local directory.
* Create a new repository on GitHub.com
	*  Make the repository private
	*  Do not initialize ReadMe, license, .gitignore files
	* You may need to setup authentication with GitHub, follow the HTTPS guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github#https)
* Copy the repository URL and open your local project directory in the terminal.
* Use the following commands:
	```bash
	$ git remote add origin [copied-repo-URL]
	$ git remote -v
	```
	1. links local directory to GitHub Repo
	2. verifies link was successful

#### 3. Push changes in local directory to GitHub.com
* Run the following command:
	```bash
	$ git push -u origin main
	```

#### .gitignore

You can setup [gitignore](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files) files so, that Git ignores files you do not want added to GitHub.

[Here](https://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657) is an example of a .gitignore file.
