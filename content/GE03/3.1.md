## Set Up Database and Admin

In this section you will set up the admin and initial database tables that come with Django.

#### Set Up Database and Migrations
In this section you will migrate the database setup into the default Django SQLite database.
1. Open a terminal at your 'portfolio' directory.
2. Ensure you are on the correct branch: `git branch`
3. Activate the Django virtual environment: `source djvenv/bin activate`
4. Run server: `python manage.py runserver`

To fix the migration errors complete the following
1. Press `CONTROL-C` on your keyboard to quit the server
2. Inside of your *djvenv* enter this command: `python manage.py migrate`
