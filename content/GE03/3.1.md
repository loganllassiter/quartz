## Version Control

Initialize a second branch for the GE03 sprint to do your development work in.

>[!note]
> You can do this through the terminal or GitHub
>

#### Using the terminal

1. Open a the terminal at your project directory and use commands:
	``` bash
	git branch sprint02
	git checkout sprint02
	```

     <sub>This creates a branch "sprint02" and switches to that branch</sub>

>```

#### Using GitHub

1. Go to your project repository on [GitHub.com](https://github.com)

## Database and Migration

In this section you will migrate the database setup into the default Django SQLite database.
1. Open a terminal at your 'portfolio' directory.
2. Ensure you are on the correct branch: `git branch`
3. Activate the Django virtual environment: `source djvenv/bin activate`
4. Run server: `python manage.py runserver`

>[!note]
>Notice that there are migration errors

To fix the migration errors complete the following
5. Press `CONTROL-C` on your keyboard to quit the server
6. Inside of your *djvenv* enter this command: `python manage.py migrate`

>[!Note]
>The migration errors are gone

## SQLite

We will be using PyCharm, and SQLite is one of the built-in databases we can use.

1. In PyCharm:
	- Go to the *View* menu
	- Under *Tool Windows* select *Database*
	![[Screenshot 2024-03-02 at 6.36.02 PM.png|500]]
	
	Click on the `+` symbol and under *Data Source* select *SQLite*
	
	![[Screenshot 2024-03-02 at 6.37.22 PM.png|300]]
	
	A pop up will appear, if necessary download any libraries or packages needed to work with SQL. Click *OK* and you will see an SQLite database under the *Database* tab
	![[Screenshot 2024-03-02 at 6.38.55 PM.png|400]]
	
	The console will be reachable on the left hand side along with all the `.py` files
