## Required Fields

1. If you would like to add a student you can click the ![[Screenshot 2024-03-03 at 11.25.25 AM.png|70]] button.
	Currently, this is what you will see:

	Going back to the Create Student Model Section can give us an idea as to why these sections appear in our 'Add a Student' screen. Looking at our `models.py` we can see our Student model and its requirements. 

	For example:	
	``` python 
	major = models.CharField(max_length=200, choices=MAJOR, blank = True)
	```

>[!info]
> `Major is a type of models.CharField which means that this field contains strings.`
> - `max_length=200 means this field's maximum length will hold 200 characters.`
> - `choices=MAJOR refers to our MAJOR list which contains the drop down options.`
> - `blank = True means this field is allowed to be blank. False would make this field required.`
>

2. Currently, only a Student's name and email are required fields for adding a Student onto the portfolio application. As of yet, a major is not a required field.

3. Update the Student model code to make the attribute major required. Do not forget to migrate any/all changes made to the models in the application.
	
	Let's change `models.py:`
	``` python 
		major = models.CharField(max_length=200, choices=MAJOR, blank = False)
	```

4. A major is now apart of the required fields necessary to add a Student.

2. Click "SAVE"  to successfully add this Student model iteration.
3. Notice that on the student table, the newly created student entity is called "Student object (1)" - not very informative.
