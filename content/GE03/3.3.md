1. Open your 'portfolio' project in PyCharm
2. Navigate to `portfolio > portfolio_app > models.py` 
3. Create a student model by inserting the following code:
	```python
	from django.db import models  
  
  
	# Create your models here.  
	class Student(models.Model):  
	    # List of choices for major value in database, human readable name  
	    MAJOR = (  
	        ('CSCI-BS', 'BS in Computer Science'),  
	        ('CPEN-BS', 'BS in Computer Engineering'),  
	        ('BIGD-BI', 'BI in Game Design and Development'),  
	        ('BICS-BI', 'BI in Computer Science'),  
	        ('BISC-BI', 'BI in Computer Security'),  
	        ('CSCI-BA', 'BA in Computer Science'),  
	        ('DASE-BS', 'BS in Data Analytics and Systems Engineering')  
	    )  
	    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)  
	    email = models.CharField("UCCS Email", max_length=200)  
	    major = models.CharField(max_length=200, choices=MAJOR, blank=True)
	```
	<sup>Ensure your indentation is correct</sup>

4.  Perform migrations in Django to add class models to database table.
	``` bash
	python manage.py makemigrations
	python manage.py migrate
	```
	This command will create migration files based off of our changes. Below we can see that we did create a model called Student. To 'commit' or apply our changes, run the second command

> [!Note]
> *We can now see the Student model in the migrations folder*

5. Start the server (if it wasn't running already).
	``` bash
	python manage.py runserver
	```

6. Navigate to the `admin.py` file; once there, register the new Student Model.
	```python
	from django.contrib import admin
	from .models import Student

	admin.site.register(Student)
	```

	The Student table has been added:
