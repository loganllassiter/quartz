## Overriding in Django

1. Time to override code. Navigate to 
	`portfolio > portfolio_app > models.py`
	
2. We will be defining two functions, one of which requires you to import the python URLs reverse at the top of the file.

3. Below the major attribute, add the following code.

4. Your final `models.py` file should look like the following:

	``` python
	from django.db import models  
	from django.urls import reverse  
	  
	  
	# Create your models here.  
	class Student(models.Model):  
	  
	    # List of choices for major value in database, human readable name  
	    MAJOR = (  
	    ('CSCI-BS', 'BS in Computer Science'),  
	    ('CPEN-BS', 'BS in Computer Engineering'),  
	    ('BIGD-BI', 'BI in Game Design and Development'),  
	    ('BICS-BI', 'BI in Computer Science'),  
	    ('BISC-BI', 'BI in Computer Security'),  
	    ('CSCI-BA', 'BA in Computer Science'),  
	    ('DASE-BS', 'BS in Data Analytics and Systems Engineering')  
	    )  
	    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)  
	    email = models.CharField("UCCS Email", max_length=200)  
	    major = models.CharField(max_length=200, choices=MAJOR, blank = False)  
	  
	    #Define default String to return the name for representing the Model object."  
	    def __str__(self):  
	        return self.name  
	  
	  
	    #Returns the URL to access a particular instance of MyModelName.  
	    #if you define this method then Django will automatically    # add a "View on Site" button to the model's record editing screens in the Admin site    
	    def get_absolute_url(self):  
	        return reverse('student-detail', args=[str(self.id)])
	```

5. Save your file and refresh the admin panel to see the name now displayed.**![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/PxrVzkmoTcNFRZuthG0Py6sk1RqHW-D2iyePg0aj5hK-_ac_R2SY9SiLNjtoKZNzgSAt4IcvWe6_x7RzH25h7elii78bJKEYJ3OmERnvt2Pz2GL4YlgbX5mRzC8NTPZ_VbfXwG503A9D)**
   
>[!Info]
>`We've overridden the default name for out Student objects and are now displaying the 'name' value that our user has input. Django uses the get_absolute_url() method to create a 'View Site' button.`
>
`Clicking the button right now will raise a NoReverseMatch exception, but that's to be expected. We have not defined any of that yet.`

6. If the change isn't available, check whether your methods are indented correctly. Don't forget to push migrations whenever changes are made to the models.
