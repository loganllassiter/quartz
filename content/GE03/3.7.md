We will be creating the UML model above.

The Student model is already set up, but we do have to add a portfolio to each student.

#### Portfolio and Project Models

1. Initially, this is what I started off with:
	
	``` python
	from django.db import models
	from django.urls import reverse
	# Create your models here.  
	  
	  
	# Portfolio model  
	class Portfolio(models.Model):  
	  
	    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)  
	    contact_email = models.EmailField()  
	    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=False)  
	    about = models.TextField(blank=True)  
	  
	    def __str__(self):  
	        return self.title  
	  
	    def get_absolute_url(self):  
	        return reverse('portfolio-detail', args=[str(self.id)])  
	  
	  
	# Project model  
	class Project(models.Model):  
	  
	    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)  
	    description = models.TextField(blank=False)  
	    portfolio = models.ForeignKey(Portfolio, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  
	  
	    def __str__(self):  
	        return self.title  
	  
	    def get_absolute_url(self):  
	        return reverse('project-detail', args=[str(self.id)])  
	  
	  
	# Student model  
	class Student(models.Model):  
	  
	    # List of choices for major value in database, human readable name  
	    MAJOR = (  
	    ('CSCI-BS', 'BS in Computer Science'),  
	    ('CPEN-BS', 'BS in Computer Engineering'),  
	    ('BIGD-BI', 'BI in Game Design and Development'),  
	    ('BICS-BI', 'BI in Computer Science'),  
	    ('BISC-BI', 'BI in Computer Security'),  
	    ('CSCI-BA', 'BA in Computer Science'),  
	    ('DASE-BS', 'BS in Data Analytics and Systems Engineering')  
	    )  
	    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)  
	    email = models.CharField("UCCS Email", max_length=200)  
	    major = models.CharField(max_length=200, choices=MAJOR, blank = False)  
	    portfolio = models.OneToOneField(Portfolio, on_delete=models.CASCADE, default=None)  
	  
	    # Define default String to return the name for representing the Model object."  
	    def __str__(self):  
	        return self.name  
	  
	    # Returns the URL to access a particular instance of MyModelName.  
	    # if you define this method then Django will automatically    # add a "View on Site" button to the model's record editing screens in the Admin site    def get_absolute_url(self):  
	        return reverse('student-detail', args=[str(self.id)])
	```

>[!Info]
>`The UML model tells us most of this information, but we can find further information on the relationships among the models:`
>- [OneToOneField:](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.OneToOneField)
>	- `One key opens one single door`
>- [ForeignKey:](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/models/fields/#foreignkey)
>	- `A car has one manufacturer but a manufacturer can make many cars`
>
>`The field types correspond to the UML model`

>- `BooleanField displays:`

>
>`The order of your models matters. Both the Project and Student models have relationships with the Portfolio, so the Portfolio must be created prior to the other two models.`
>`The only difference between the str() and get_absolute_url methods are the return statement names.`

2. Make sure to register the models in `admin.py`:
	
	``` python
	from django.contrib import admin  
	from .models import Portfolio, Project, Student  
	# Register your models here.  
	  
	admin.site.register(Portfolio)  
	admin.site.register(Project)  
	admin.site.register(Student)
	```

	Now they'll show up on the admin page.
