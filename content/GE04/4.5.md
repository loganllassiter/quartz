We will now compile the following code into a manage_project.html file to create a webpage where users can add a new project to a specified student's portfolio. The code is shown below:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html lang="en">  
<head>  
    <meta charset="UTF-8">  
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">  
    <title>Add New Project</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
    <h1>Add New Project</h1>  
    <form method="post">  
        {% csrf_token %}  
        {{form.as_p }}  
        <button type="Submit">Save</button>  
    </form></body>  
</html>
```
This code will allow a user to add a new project to the student's portfolio. When the user is satisfied with the project they created, they may add it by clicking the "Save" button.

Multiple styling options can be added in the Head section of the HTML file like seen below:

We will view the effects of this styling later.

The manage_project.html file will only display properly if we set the correct path in our urls.py file:
```
urlpatterns = [  
	path('', views.index, name='index'),
    ...  
    path('manage-project/', views.manage_project, name='manage-project'),  
    ...
    # URL Pattern for Login View  
    path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(), name='login')  
]
```

The urls.py file should resemble something similar to the one seen below, with our specified path highlighted in blue for clarity sake. Please take note of the imports on the top of the file.
