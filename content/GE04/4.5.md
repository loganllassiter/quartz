1. We will now compile the following code into a manage_project.html file to create a webpage where users can add a new project to a specified student's portfolio. This code will allow a user to add a new project to the student's portfolio. When the user is satisfied with the project they created, they may add it by clicking the "Save" button. The code is shown below:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html lang="en">  
<head>  
    <meta charset="UTF-8">  
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">  
    <title>Add New Project</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
    <h1>Add New Project</h1>  
    <form method="post">  
        {% csrf_token %}  
        {{form.as_p }}  
        <button type="Submit">Save</button>  
    </form></body>  
</html>
```

2. Multiple styling options can be added in the Head section of the HTML file like seen below. We will view the effects of this styling later.

3. The manage_project.html file will only display properly if we set the correct path in urls.py:
```
urlpatterns = [  
	path('', views.index, name='index'),
    ...  
    path('manage-project/', views.manage_project, name='manage-project'),  
    ...
    # URL Pattern for Login View  
    path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(), name='login')  
]
```

4. The urls.py file should resemble something similar to the one seen below, with our specified path highlighted in blue for clarity sake. Please take note of the imports on the top of the file.

5. The manage_project.html file will only function properly if we set the correct function in our views.py file. The webpage needs to be able to display the selected project's attributes.
```
def manage_project(request, project_id=None):  
    if project_id:  
        project = get_object_or_404(Project, pk=project_id)  
    else:  
        project = None  
  
    if request.method == 'POST':  
        form = ProjectForm(request.POST, instance=project)  
        if form.is_valid():  
            form.save()  
            return redirect('project-list')  
    else:  
        form = ProjectForm(instance=project)  
    return render(request, 'portfolio_app/manage_project.html', {'form': form})
```

6. The views.py file should resemble something similar to the one seen below, with our specified path being the only method shown. Please take note of the imports on the top of the file.

8. The HTML file uses a form method in order to take input from the user when they enter the values for the project's attributes (title, description, and associated portfolio). To make an attribute a requirement for the project's recreation, we need to define a project form class that will specify it using the "required" attribute of the form field inside a forms.py file like so:   
![[Pasted image 20240319132352.png]]

9. With the above implementations, we can now click on the "Add New Project" button on the portfolio details page, which will take us to the new project page. Notice the webpage's styling, a result of the style snippet of code shown previously.

10. Returning to the portfolio details page, we will now compile the following code into an update_project.html file to create a webpage where users can update an existing project inside a specified student's portfolio. This code will allow a user to modify any connected-projects and their information. When the user is satisfied with the changes they added, they may save it by clicking the "Update" button. The code is shown below:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html lang="en">  
<head>  
    <meta charset="UTF-8">  
    <title>Update Project</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
    <h1>Update Project</h1>  
    <form method="post">  
        {% csrf_token %}  
        {{ form.as_p }}  
        <button type="submit" class="btn">Update</button>  
    </form></body>  
</html>  
```

11. Multiple styling options can be added in the Head section of the HTML file like seen below. We will view the effects of this styling later.
![[Pasted image 20240319134606.png]]

12. The update_project.html file will only display properly if we set the correct path in urls.py:
```
urlpatterns = [  
	path('', views.index, name='index'),
    ...  
    path('manage-project/<int:project_id>/', views.update_project, name='update-project'),  
    ...
    # URL Pattern for Login View  
    path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(), name='login')  
]
```

13. The urls.py file should resemble something similar to the one seen below, with our specified path highlighted in blue for clarity sake. Please take note of the imports on the top of the file.
![[Pasted image 20240319160003.png]]

14. The update_project.html file will only function properly if we set the correct function in our views.py file. The webpage needs to be able to display the selected project's attributes.
```
def update_project(request, project_id):  
    project = get_object_or_404(Project, pk=project_id)  
    if request.method == 'POST':  
        form = ProjectForm(request.POST, instance=project)  
        if form.is_valid():  
            project = form.save()  
            return redirect('portfolio-detail', portfolio_id=project.portfolio.id)  
    else:  
        form = ProjectForm(instance=project)  
    return render(request, 'portfolio_app/update_project.html', {'form': form})
```

15. The views.py file should resemble something similar to the one seen below, with our specified path being the only method shown. Please take note of the imports on the top of the file.

16. The HTML file uses a form method in order to take input from the user when they modify the values for the project's attributes (title, description, and associated portfolio). To make an attribute a requirement for the project's recreation, we will be using the project form class previously defined inside the forms.py file. To make an attribute a requirement inside the form class, refer to the code shown below:
```
def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):  
    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)  
    self.fields['required_attribute'].required = True
```

15. With the above implementations, we can now click on the "Update" button on the portfolio details page, which will take us to the update project page. Notice the webpage's styling, a result of the style snippet of code shown previously.
