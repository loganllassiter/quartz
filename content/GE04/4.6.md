1. We will now compile the following code into a delete_project.html file to give users the option to remove an existing project from a specified student's portfolio. This code will confirm that the user intends to remove the selected project from the student's portfolio. When the user is confident with the project they selected, they may remove it by clicking the "Delete" button. The code is shown below:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html lang="en">  
<head>  
    <meta charset="UTF-8">  
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">  
    <title>Delete Project</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
    <h1>Delete Project</h1>  
    <p>Are you sure you want to delete this project?</p>  
    <form method="post">  
        {% csrf_token %}  
        <button type="submit">Delete</button>  
        <a href="{% url 'portfolio-detail' portfolio_id %}">Cancel</a>  
    </form></body>  
</html>
```

2. The delete_project.html file will only display properly if we set the correct path in our urls.py:
```
urlpatterns = [  
	path('', views.index, name='index'),
    ...  
    path('project/<int:project_id>/delete/', views.delete_project, name='delete-project'), 
    ...
    # URL Pattern for Login View  
    path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(), name='login')  
]
```

3. The urls.py file should resemble something similar to the one seen below, with our specified path highlighted in blue for clarity sake. Please take note of the imports on the top of the file.

4. The delete_project.html file will only function properly if we set the correct function in our views.py file. The webpage needs to be able to display a message confirming the action.
```
@require_POST  
def delete_project(request, project_id):  
    project = get_object_or_404(Project, id=project_id)  
    project.delete()  
    return redirect('portfolio-detail', portfolio_id=project.portfolio.id)
```

5. The views.py file should resemble something similar to the one seen below, with our specified path highlighted in blue for clarity sake. Please take note of the imports on the top of the file.

6.  With the above implementations, we can now click on the "Delete" button on the portfolio details page, which will prompt user to confirm the project removal.
